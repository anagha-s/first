# first

hi, i'm anagha-s!

welcome to my first github project, adequately named "first".
i'm mainly a hobbyist, apart from studying...

i like java, both the language and the drink!
i like python (the language), and i'm not afraid of snakes.
i adore raspberry pie, and have yet to learn raspberry pi.

see you on the other side!
